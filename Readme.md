# 🌐 Marathi-Transformer: Neural Machine Translation from Scratch 🚀  

Welcome to **Marathi-Transformer**! This project implements the **Transformer architecture from scratch** for **English-to-Marathi translation**. Inspired by the revolutionary paper **"Attention is All You Need"**, it leverages self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding to achieve high-quality translations.  

## ✨ Features  
- Full implementation of the Transformer model from scratch 🛠️  
- Attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships 🔍  
- Positional encoding for handling sequence information 📏  
- Training on bilingual English-Marathi datasets 🗣️  

## 📝 Project Goal  
The main goal of this project is to build a robust **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** model that efficiently translates English text to Marathi using modern deep learning techniques.  

## 📑 Paper Reference  
The architecture is inspired by the groundbreaking paper:  
**"Attention is All You Need"** by Vaswani et al.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
Currently setting up the core model and data pipeline. Stay tuned for updates!
